# IHNIL - I Hate Nested If Loops

## Description

Prounced: "eye-nil"  
For use on Python code modules.  
I hate nested "if" loops. They're ugly, they're slow, they've got to go.  
While there are *some* instances where they are necessary, let's see if we  
can get ride of all of the useless ones.  

## Usage

After installation, run via with the arguments below in the terminal:  

```
python3 reader.py [ -r/--read | -w/--read ] [ -h/--help ] filename  
```  

Currently only available for Python 3.  

## Development

This project has several phases listed below:  
- [X] Identify nested loop statements
- [X] Print results errors to the terminal
- [ ] Parse statements to identify improvements
- [ ] Print improvements to the terminal
- [ ] Insert recommendations into the code\
- [ ] Develop PyPI modularity distribution
- [ ] Identify unecessary stacked "if" statements (**long term**)
- [ ] Identify list comprehension options (**longER term**)

Other additions may be made to the list as the project develops.
